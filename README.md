# Newport Now Client Project
#### November â€“ December 2016

Client project for NewportNow to create a website that allows users to see and search all the different businesses around Newport and add a business if necessary

Used Flask (Python framework) to create a functional server with security implementations.

Used HTML & CSS, JavaScript (including JQuery and AJAX) to produce an interactive and dynamic website.

Used SQLite to manage databases and link them to the server allowing them to be manipulated by the user.
